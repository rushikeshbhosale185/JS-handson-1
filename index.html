    <p><pre>Q.1) You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to add these two numbers.</pre></p>
    <h3>Ans: <pre>
        const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
            return a+b; 
          };
    </pre></h3>

    <p><pre> Q.2) You are given two numbers first as <b>"A"</b> and second as <b> "B" </b>and check if both  conditions are ( A <10 and A > B ) are satisfied or not with the help of operators. </10>  </pre></p>
    <h3> Ans: <pre>
        const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {

            if (a < 10 && a > b){
              return true;
            }
            else {
              return false;
            }
              
        };
            
    </pre></h3>
    <br><hr>

    <p><pre>Q.3) You are given two numbers <b>"A"</b> and <b>"B"</b>. 
        You need to do the following checks:
        
        <b>   (i) if both are divisible by 10 console true.
          (ii) if both are not divisible by 10 console false.
         (iii) if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.</b>

        Use operators to do this.
    </pre></p>
    <h3> Ans: <pre>
        const Check = (A, B) => {
  
            if (A % 10 == 0 && B % 10 == 0){
              return true;
            }
            else if (A % 10 != 0 && B % 10 != 0){
              return false;
            }
            else {
              return true;

    <p><pre>Q.4) You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the first digit of that number.
    </pre></p>
    <h3>Ans : <pre>
        const First_Digit = (n) => {

            return parseInt(n/1000);

    <h3>Ans: <pre>
        const Last_Digit = (n) => {
  
            return n%10;
            
         };
    </pre></h3>

    <p><pre>Q.6) You are provided with two numbers A and B where A as divisor and B as dividend.Your task is find the remainder.
    </pre></p>
    <h3>Ans: <pre>
        const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) => {
    
            return b%a;
            
        };
